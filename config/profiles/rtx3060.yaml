# RAG-KB Pipeline Configuration - RTX 3060 Profile (12GB VRAM)
#
# Best for: Desktop workstations, mid-range GPU servers
#
# Usage:
#   cp config/profiles/rtx3060.yaml config/pipeline.yaml
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f config/profiles/docker-compose.gpu.yaml up
#
# Expected Performance (estimated - GPU support untested):
#   - Embedding speed: ~500-1000 docs/min
#   - Query latency: 0.3-0.8s (with reranking)
#   - VRAM usage: ~4GB (embedder + reranker)
#
# WARNING: GPU configurations are currently UNTESTED - awaiting hardware delivery.
#          The `device: cuda` settings are commented out until validation.
